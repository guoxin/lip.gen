This package of codes generates Table 2 of the draft "Towards a Mathematical Foundation of Immunology and Amino Acid Chains" available at arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6031v2

The C dynamic library should be compiled in unix-like system (e.g. MacOS, Linux) since POSIX thread tool is used. To compile, just type

$ make

and the Makefile script will finish all the things.

The file "reports.Rdata" is just the output of the codes described at the previous post https://sites.google.com/site/guoxinmath/home/animplementationofthekearnelrlsalgorithmpredictingpeptideaffinities or at github: https://github.com/guoxin/fix.all.imp.git (commit ca26bb88837be1eecb7ea3de445f9982ef950515). However you if you run the codes on your machine you may get slightly different numerical results due to the implementation of your compiler, R version, or something else.

To generate the computing results, type 

$ Rscript generateLip.R

This package of codes is available and being updated on github https://github.com/guoxin/lip.gen.git.
